# USCC Headquarter's Instruction Set Architecture
#  System Design:
#   - Four function calculator
#   - Can only operate on numbers stored in registers
#   - Processor receives binary data as 32-bit strings
#   - Returns results to the terminal
#   - Can operate on 10-bit numbers (0 thru 1023)
#   - Results can be negative (5 - 10 = -5)
#  Instruction format:
#   - 32 bit's in length
#   - Binary data will come to the CPU as a string
#   - Registers (32 total on CPU, 0-indexed)
#      - 0 thru 21:  Available for number storage
#        - 0: Constant 0
#      - 22 thru 31: Available for history storage

#   - Bits 0-5 are OPCODEs
#     - use variable 'opcode' in program
#   - Bits 6-10 & 11-15 are source register locations
#     - use variables 'source_one' and 'source_two' in program
#   - Bits 16-25 are reserved for adding a new value to the registers
#     - use variable 'store' in program
#   - Bits 26-31 are functions
#     - use variable 'function_code' in program

# | OPCODE | FUNCTION | Definition                          |
# | 000000 |  100000  | Add two numbers from registers      |
# | 000000 |  100010  | Subtract two numbers from registers |
# | 000000 |  011000  | Multiply two numbers from registers |
# | 000000 |  011010  | Divide two numbers from registers   |
# | 000001 |  000000  | Store value to next register        |
# | 100001 |  000000  | Return previous calculation         |
